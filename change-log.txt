- Rewriting code for editmem.pug and rowElementEdit-mixin.pug with the 
  intention of making it cleaner. Maintain a focus on writing clean and
  understandable code. 
- Task completed. Code is much cleaner and edit functionality has been  
  retained.

- Making a design decision. Either we do constant book-keeping tasks
  to keep a table with all the availabilites or we recalculate the 
  availabilities each time. The first option is more scalable but
  makes it difficult to update whenever we delete a member. 
  Our team is small and so we should not need to find than 25 
  availabilities at a time. Thus we will recalculate the availabilities 
  each time. 
- Basic find has been implemented.
